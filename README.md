# Machine Learning Notebooks

This is a series of research/tutorial jupyter notebooks demonstrating basic concepts and applications of various machine learning techniques in python. Using scikit-learn, numpy, and keras we plan to cover basics like simple neural networks, preprocessing data, dimensionality reduction/visualization of high-deminsional datasets and even hyperparameter search. Check back regularly for new notebooks as we continue our research.
