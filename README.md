# Machine Learning Notebooks

This is a series of research/tutorial jupyter notebooks demonstrating basic concepts and applications of various machine learning techniques in python. Using scikit-learn, numpy, and keras we plan to cover basics like simple neural networks, preprocessing data, dimensionality reduction/visualization of high-dimensional datasets and even hyperparameter search. Check back regularly for new notebooks as we continue our research.

## Notebooks

- Preprocessing Data: Learn to preprocess data using normalization and standardization on input features.
	- [Pokemon classification](notebooks/preprocessing_pokemon_classification.ipynb)
	- [Human activity classification](notebooks/preprocessing_human_activity_classification.ipynb) using mobile accelerometer data
- [Hyperparameter Search](notebooks/hyperparameter_search.ipynb): Automate the process of selecting/fine tuning the hyperparameters used in a neural network.
- [Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction](notebooks/clustering_and_dimensionality_reduction.ipynb): Use K-means clustering that groups similar english words using [GloVe embeddings](https://github.com/brannondorsey/glove-experiments).
